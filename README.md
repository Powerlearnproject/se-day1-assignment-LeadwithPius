Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software Engineering is the systemiv application of Engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintainance of high quality software systems.
-It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages like C and fortran
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3. The rise of agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements; Collection and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design; Creation of high level and detailed designs of the software achitecture and user interface.
3. Implementation; Writing code and building the software.
4. Testing; Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment; Releasing the software to users and customers
6. Maintanance; Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like waterfall while agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the quality of software by testing designs
Project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- examples are: Codeblocs and Visual Studio Code, they provide tools for writing, compiling, debugging and testing code
Vcs- examples are: Git, software tools for tracking changes to source code

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements that leads to scope creep, may be solved by implementation of agile methodologies and prioritization of tasks.
2. Tight deadlines can be solved by proper communication with the client

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit; testing of individual components
2. Integration testing; testing interactions between different components
3. System testing; Testing the entire software system as a whole
4. Acceptance testing is testing it against the user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
   -they help identify and fix defects early in the development cycle

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
is the art of crafting questions or statements with the aim of getting the best possible responses from AI models
helps avoid getting unclear and vague responses from Ai models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
tell me about Nairobi - Vague
Tell me about Nairobi as a city and its tourist attractions and interesting things to do in the city.
